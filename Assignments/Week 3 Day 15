### Week 3 Day 15

// Normal

// - add a small label to the Start View Controller to show Top Score (should pull from singleton topScore)
// - integrate GameData.swift into app
// - connect currentScore to score updates within game
// - make the brick creation dynamic based on the level info from game data singleton
// - add comments to GameData.swift explaining what everything is

// Hard

// - when you win a game, increment currentLevel and switch current game controller with a new one to play next level
// - make currentScore back to 0 when you lose... but keep it going through next level

// Nightmare

// - add a brick busted count & ball lost count to singleton
// - add stats view controller with values from singleton and play button to send to next level
// - if you lost the stats view should show a game over button that send you to start view controller
