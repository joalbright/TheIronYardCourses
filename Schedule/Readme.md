### Instructor & T.A. Availability

Daily Schedule

Lab time is generally from 1pm - 5pm daily and all day on Friday.

Keep in mind that often the best way to learn is to work through the situation by yourself, but we will be available to assist.

There is also a chance we will be available via Slack or [Screenhero](http://screenhero.com/) in the evenings or weekends. If we are and can help we will do so, but don't plan on this. Make sure to ask any questions you have before you leave for the day.
