### Manifesto

### Late homework policy

Your homework needs to be submitted by 8AM on the day it is due. After that, it is late.

We would rather see a solid attempt on time than a complete assignment late.

### Honor code

You are expected to do your own work. You should use all resources available to you, including open-source code, but copy and pasting open-source code is prohibited. You should use it only for inspiration or as a library in a bigger project.

If you are not able to explain the code, then you shouldn't be using it.

Copying homework is taken very seriously and can result in being asked to leave The Iron Yard.

### Absence & Other Policies

Please refer to your Atlanta Student Bulletin.
