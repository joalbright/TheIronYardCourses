## Welcome

Welcome to The Iron Yard! We are super excited to start class on September 21st, 2015 with all of you. We've put together a short list of things you could start reviewing before class on Monday. 

Pay especially close attention to the list of requirements for our install party.

Also, keep in mind that if you get stuck during any of this, don’t sweat it. We will be covering all of this in class. This is just a nice way to make you aware of some of the tools we will be diving into.

If you have any questions. Please email either me anytime: [jo@theironyard.com](mailto:jo@theironyard.com)

## Your Workstation

Other than your brain, the most important tool you will use is your workstation. Making sure it is properly set up is extremely important. This is the reason we do the install party. Here are some things you'll need to make sure you have.

- Macbook Air or Pro running the latest [OSX](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-yosemite/id915041082?mt=12)
- Clean up your machine. Those of you who have not started with a new machine, take some time to clean up your desktop and even your file system if possible.
- Make sure you always have your charging cable with you

## Xcode 6

You will be living in Xcode for 12 straight weeks. Xcode is much more than a text editor, and you will need to do more than just write code within it. You will need to get comfortable with navigating this IDE. Go ahead and sign up as an **Individual** for the Apple Developer program.

- Signup for [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/programs/)
- [Xcode 6](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) (you can download it in the Mac app store)

## Git & GitHub

We will utilize version control for all of your work and specifically we will use Git. Don’t worry, we’ll show you how to get that installed on your machine. For now thought, take a look at the following resources and go ahead and sign up for a Github.com account if you don’t already have one.

- Signup for [GitHub](http://github.com)
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)
- [MacDown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com)

## Prework

Here are a few things for you to do to straight your brain muscles.
